  <h1>R</h1>
  <aside class="notes">
    Over the next few hours,
    we will introduce you to the R statistical programming environment.
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>What It Is</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A statistical analysis package, a language, and a way of life.
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      A number of sophisticated analyses are available straight out of the box.
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      Full-featured programming language that allows development of more specialized packages.
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      A staggering number of free, specialized packages that extend core functionality.
    </li>
     <li class="fragment">
      R has a great community - R Geeks everywhere.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <aside class="notes">
    R is a programming language built specifically for statistical
    analysis and simulation.
    You can work with it interactively at a console, or you
    can write scripts to do complex data manipulation and analysis.
    With easy access to hundreds of free specialised extensions,
    R is one of the most flexible and sophisticated options available
    for statistical analysis.
    The learning curve can be a bit steep at first, but once
    you master the basics you will be amazed at what you can do!
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>Basic functionality</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Import and manipulate common data formats such as .txt, .csv. xls
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      Transform and analyze data using a broad array of built-in functionality
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      Basic data summaries and visualization, often in a single command
    </li>
  </ul>
  <aside class="notes">
    Basic R skills will eliminate the need for other statistical or data management
    software, giving you access to common analyses and visualization methods with no
    additional packages needed.  The learning curve can be somewhat steep for users
    who have never done any programming before, but the added flexibility and repeatability
    afforded by a more "hands-on" approach to stats are well worth the effort, even
    if you don't take advantage of R's extended functionality.
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>Extended functionality</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Import and manipulate less common data formats (e.g., GIS data formats, image 
      stacks from medical imaging systems) using freely available libraries
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      Huge base of user-created packages for specialized applications
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      Generate publication-ready plots of any type you can imagine using
      extensive plotting and visualization libraries
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      Automate, innovate, and share with the community
    </li>
  </ul>
  <aside class="notes">
    Learning to code R well can open up a wealth of new opportunities for you.  You can
    do a better job of analyzing your own data, and save yourself time and money. When 
    you start to get really good at it, you can also contribute to the endlessly-growing 
    capabilities of R itself, allowing other scientists to use your home-grown
    analytical methods on their own data.

<section>
  <h1>R as a programming language</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      New tools/ procedures can be written in R, shared and used by others.
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      Open-source and R packages
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      Integration with other tools
    </li>
  </ul>
  <aside class="notes">
    Don't know what a function does? Look at code yourself!
    Don't agree with how a function works? Re-write it!
    Extend R with more functions, data and graphics. CRAN (Comprehensive R archive network) 
    has >5000 packages and Bioconductor has almost 1000 packages.
    <a href="http://rpy.sourceforge.net/">Call R from Python.</a>
    <a href="http://rpython.r-forge.r-project.org/">Call Python from R.</a>
    Access MySQL database (RMySQL).
    Google Maps API (RGoogleMaps).

<section>
  <h1>Reproducible Research</h1>
  <ul>
  	<li>
		What if someone questions your analysis five years from now?  
		Will you remember what you did?
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      R scripts record the commands you use to analyze your data, so you can inspect and repeat them later.
    </li>
    <li class="fragment">
      Analyses done in GUIs are usually NOT reproducible - maybe you can 
      get a result easily, but will you remember HOW you did it when it comes
      time to write the paper or reanalyze the data?
    </li>
    
  </ul>
  <aside class="notes">
    R code is written in a plain text file. Running the same code on the same data should reproduce
    the exact same results. R "scripts" are easily shared. "Latex, Knitr, Sweave" etc allow seamless 
    integration of R code into a self-documenting report.

    We will only explore a dozen or so commands in this lesson.
    Our real goal is to teach you how R works
    and how best to use it as a tool for reproducible research and data/ statistical analysis language.
    If you'd like to know more,
    we recommend C Gandrud's
    <em>Reproducible Research with R and RStudio</em>,
    which is good both as a tutorial and as a reference.
    and Y Xie's
    <em>Dynamic documents with R and knitr</em>
